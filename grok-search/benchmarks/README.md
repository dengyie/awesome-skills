# Public benchmark

This directory contains the public, reproducible part of the grok-search evaluation.

Included:

- `lib/benchmark-15q-v2.mjs`: frozen 15-question set, expected fields, official URLs, and deterministic patterns.
- `run-responses-15q.mjs`: provider-neutral Responses runner using the normal grok-search configuration.
- `score-responses-15q.mjs`: deterministic correctness and official-source scoring.
- `public/2026-07-11-summary.json`: sanitized aggregate sample from the original study.

Excluded from Git:

- raw provider responses and internal IDs;
- complete fetched page bodies;
- private proxy and relay configuration;
- per-request channel pricing and failure logs;
- historical Chat protocol probes.

Run a small subset first to control cost:

```bash
npm run benchmark -- --only node,rust,python
npm run benchmark:score
```

Runs write raw responses to `benchmarks/results/`, which is intentionally ignored by Git. The historical experiment archive and internal reports remain under the separate local-only `.private/` directory.

## Experiment scripts

Not part of the scored benchmark. Both send real, billed requests and write one JSON per case
plus a summary to `--out DIR` (default under `benchmarks/results/`, ignored by Git). Findings and
decisions are kept in the local-only `.agent/` notes.

- `provider-compare.mjs`: the same questions, URLs and sites through Grok, Tavily, Firecrawl and
  Direct (`--part search|fetch|map|all`). Used on 2026-09-08 to decide X-post routing
  (Direct first) and to turn extras off for `--source x`.
- `tool-call-cap-experiment.mjs`: one web and one X query posted straight to the Responses
  endpoint with `max_tool_calls`, `parallel_tool_calls` and `max_turns` variants
  (`--only web|x --ids a,b --repeat N`). Result: `max_tool_calls` is ignored by api.x.ai and by
  relays; `parallel_tool_calls: false` gives one call per turn; the model matters more than
  either knob.

## Grader amendments

The question set, truth snapshots, and official URLs stay frozen. Scoring regexes may gain
synonym translations when a semantically correct answer is rejected on vocabulary alone:

- 2026-08-10: the `rust` criterion for "symbol mangling v0" also accepts 修饰 (the
  `rust-vs-deno` criterion already did); a correct answer phrased as 符号修饰 had scored as a miss.
