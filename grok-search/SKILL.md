# Grok Search

Node scripts for web search, URL fetch and site mapping. Run `npm install` once. Run scripts from the grok-search root (the directory of this SKILL.md): `cd` there or use absolute paths.

## Choose The Script

- URL given → `scripts/fetch.js`.
- Site named, URL unknown → `scripts/map.js`, then `fetch.js` on the URLs you pick.
- Current/latest information, or URL unknown → `scripts/search.js`.
- Question about the user's local machine → inspect local files first; search only to interpret them.

Run the fewest commands that answer the question; run independent sub-questions in parallel. Do not chain map → fetch → search.

## Commands

```bash
./scripts/search.js "plain keywords"
./scripts/search.js --instructions "what to return, language, what to leave out" "plain keywords"
./scripts/search.js --responses-allowed-domains github.com "plain keywords"
./scripts/search.js --source x --x-from-date 2026-07-01 "what people say about ..."
./scripts/fetch.js https://example.com        # --max-chars 50000 only for a deliberate deep read
./scripts/map.js https://docs.example.com --limit 20
```

Query rules:

- The query is a keyword string that Tavily/Firecrawl search verbatim, so keep it short. Everything else (fields wanted, language, "quote and date only, no advice, say if not found") goes in `--instructions`; only Grok sees it. A bag of keywords like `GPT Codex 1M 272k context window` makes Grok invent background; `codex context window` plus an instruction asking for the current limit does not.
- No code-search operators (`repo:`, `path:`, `language:`). Scope with `--responses-allowed-domains`; it restricts Grok, Tavily, and Firecrawl alike, and off-domain leftovers rank last.
- Budget about 2 searches per question. Before a second search, name the gap it closes. Do not carry the previous round's conclusion words into the keywords; for the same X handle, change the gap, not the phrasing.

## Search Source

Default is web. `--source x` for what people are saying, a named account's posts, a thread, or a claim only circulating on X. `--source both` for a current event where reporting and reaction both matter. `--source x` cannot fall back to the web and turns Tavily/Firecrawl off (`--extra N` forces them).

- For "is it available now / current state" questions, start with `--x-from-date` 60–90 days back; widen only if empty. Old issues explain history, not the present.
- X posts are personal statements: cite handle and date (both live in `answer.text`, not the card), keep claims separate from confirmations, confirm facts at the official source.
- Cost: when an X search reports `responses_tool_calls.total` above 6, add `--responses-parallel-tool-calls false` next time: one call per turn, so `max_turns` caps the count; below 6 it saves nothing.
- Handle filters, dates, media flags, card fields: `references/x-search.md`.

## Fetch Cost

- X posts: `auto` tries Direct first (free, main post with date). `--provider firecrawl` only for the thread or replies; about 30 credits per post.
- Fetch only evidence that would change the conclusion: one or two URLs per turn, a representative post or two for experience reports, never re-fetch text you have. Reddit and YouTube return shells from every provider.
- When citing decisive evidence, record date, model version, client, and login method.

## Reading Results

Every script prints one JSON object, also on failure (non-zero exit, stderr line).

- `error`: read `error.message`, `error.code`, `diagnostics.provider_attempts`. Change something before retrying (query, `--provider`, `--model`). `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: the whole command hit its time budget (default 240s, `--deadline N`).
- `diagnostics.warnings` and `diagnostics.provider_attempts` say which providers were skipped (e.g. Firecrawl in cooldown), failed, or produced content, and whether the relay served another model than requested.
- Search: `answer.text`, then `sources.items` (merged, max 12). `source_type` `citation` = used in the answer, `searched` = only listed; `opened: true` = Grok read the page. `sources.raw_path` always points to the run record (full list, answer, tool calls); read it in chunks only when the cards are not enough. Check `diagnostics.degraded`, `cost_usd`, and `search_budget` (advisory budget vs. calls made).
- Fetch: `content.text`; if `content.truncated`, read `content.full_path` in chunks or rerun once with a larger `--max-chars`. `metadata` has title/author/published_at when the provider had them. `diagnostics.run_path` is the run record.
- Map: `urls`; fetch the few you need.

Provider order, proxy, cooldown, config errors: `references/providers.md`. Multi-part or conflicting research: `references/planning.md` first.
